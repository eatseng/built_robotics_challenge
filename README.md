Challenge prompt

Can you build a jumble solver in Python 3?

You'll have to download a word list, and then take a word as user input (CLI is fine), and finally
return matching “sub-anagrams”. Make sure your program can find words that use a subset of
the provided letters, as well as true anagrams that use every letter.

Example

$ python3 jumble_solver.py corncob_lowercase.txt dog
god
go
do
